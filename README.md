# Learning Next.js
This is a project created from a YouTube tutorial to create a JAMStack blog using Next.js and Strapi CMS.

[Blog with Next.js and and Strapi CMS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=599ogMbXIyA) on YouTube, (1h 43m)

[There is a Strapi CMS back-end repo too](https://github.com/davidyell/learn-jamstack-strapi)

## Project
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
